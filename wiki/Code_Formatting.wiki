#summary Our personal project code formatting style


  * private member names in CamelCase with an underscore after - ex: PrivateMember_
  * class function names in lower case with underscores between - ex: function_name()
  * constructors have their first letter caps - Ex: MyClass()
  * references to code we wrote should use the "this." qualifier, while ref's to code outside the project should not use the qualifier

Ex: this.MyVariable_ ; this.my_function() ;
