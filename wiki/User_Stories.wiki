= Long-Term Objectives =

 * Implement a model-view-controller architecture for the UI, with a pub sub notification system for passing messages around the app. Notification system should be open enough that we can attach a socket observer + publisher to it and run messages across the network transparently. (Ben)

 * A graphical menu system allows to choose gameplay type, join a network game, etc...
 * Users take turns drawing, rotating and placing tiles on a graphical playing field according to game rules.
 * User can place meeple (small morphing people) and claim parts of the board territory.
 * User is awarded points based on scoring rules
 * Game tracks deck of tiles and randomly draws tiles for players
 * Game may be played over a local network or by multiple players on the same machine
 * Game will have different pre*set terrain sets and will give the user the ability to create their own. 
 * Users playing over a network can type to chat amongst each other.
